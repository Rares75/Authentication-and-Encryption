# Authentication-and-Encryption
My first small project on my way trying to learn and understand how cybersecurity works

I tried to make this project step by step, every task was doing a small part of my project,and everytime i tried to improve my coding skills and make it much more easier to read. I used C++ and CryptoPP library for this project. This small app helped me to understand more about C++ language and also it helped me to understand some basics in cybersecurity and how does this work.
